Search-and-replaces in a string haystack. This is an implementation of the pseudo-standard string `translate`
replacement function found in other languages, which avoids recursively re-replacing the found matches in the already
replaced values. This is achieved by moving pointer forward when a found needle value is replaced with the wanted
**to** value, which then avoid erroneously searching for needles from the already replaced **to** value. Written
in TypeScript, and supports both client-side web browser and Node.js backend usage.

üìù Example Usage
-----

### Replace substrings

The following would replace the original `red` substring with `blue` and `blue` with `red`:

```typescript
import {tr} from '@gocom/tr';

const result = tr(
  'blue, red, yellow',
  {
    'red': 'blue',
    'blue': 'red',
  }
);
```

The above `result` variable would become:

```
red, blue, yellow
```
